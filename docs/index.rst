Overview
========

The Python TWAIN module provides an interface to scanners,
digital cameras and other devices which implement TWAIN,
for the Windows platform.

It provides the functionality to allow a Python application to connect to the
scanner/camera and to retrieve images from that device.

On 64 bit Windows you need to install 64 bit TWAIN DSM: http://sourceforge.net/projects/twain-dsm/

TWAIN specification can be found here: http://www.twain.org/scanner-application-developers/specification-and-tools.html
